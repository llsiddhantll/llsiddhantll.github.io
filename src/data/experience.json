      "Postmanâ€™s app is a web developerâ€™s best friend. It is an irreplaceable toolchain for working with APIs.",
      "A fresh college graduate, I was looking for a place that would let me have an impact. I interned here for 6 months, and was ultimately hired as a third to the small team of engineers that built and maintained the Postman app. This meant writing a ton of JavaScript, support on GitHub issues and a lot of mistakes. A lot. It was glorious. During my time here, I modernized the Collection Runnerâ€™s UI and underlying data model (which is just fancy-talk for a rewrite). I also got to work with a brilliant team as we rewrote huge parts of the app to support Workspaces within the app.",

      "I moved to Berlin to join Perdoo. A young programmer out to face the world. Magical ðŸŒˆ. I was brought on to maintain their entire UI library and their web dashboard. I introduced Storybook to the UI library and refactored old components to be more reusable (and pretty!). We also ported legacy code over to have a more linear (read, predictable) data flow. Ended up crushing the number of monthly bug reports to half of what it was! We had a React Native app that was built by a freelancer before me, but I took that over, just because I loved the code theyâ€™d written.",
