On a YouTube binge? The day‚Äôs ticking away, get some work done! Overslept on a weekend? Life doesn‚Äôt wait for you.",

If you didn‚Äôt read my About section, I‚Äôm addicted to this game. So natually, I watch these championship livestreams on Twitch all year long.",
            "I wanted to build a bot that would watch these streams for me, and let me know when something interesting happens. So, for example, when someone scored a goal, the bot would tell my server, who would broadcast it out to all listening clients. My idea was to automate esports journalism.",
            "I knew I would have to battle with Computer Vision, but the Machine Learning thing came outta nowhere, honestly. I managed to ultimately write a bot that did what I wanted. The only problem? It wasn‚Äôt as accurate as humans. Now that‚Äôs expected, but it wasn‚Äôt accurate enough to be dependable. After a lot of nights in the bathroon crying, I had to finally give up. I was moving to Berlin around this time, and unfortunately, this project bit the dust.",

So you open up the app, choose what you feel like eating, pick a time, and you‚Äôre done. Other people near you would do the same, and the app would group similar people together. Once you‚Äôre in a group, you can collectively decide on a venue (the app suggests some places, but there‚Äôs a chat so you can ignore that if that‚Äôs what your group wants).",
